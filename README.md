Description: A coilgun utilizes electromagnetic forces to accelerate a ferromagnetic object to high speeds. By turning on and off some inducers at the right time using infrared sensors, an iron core can be accelerated to high speeds. The coilgun, unlike most DIY projects online, will be packaged into a portable nerf-gun style casing and will have many safety features to ensure proper usage and care. A small display can be used to to view the capacitors charge, toggle which stages activate, etc. 

Inspiration: I was initially inspired months ago by a different competition. It was a 3d modeling competition, and I really wanted to design something that could hold objects in midair using magnets. That lead me down a rabbit hole into railguns, guass guns, and even permanent magnet battering rams. Eventually though I saw a Hacksmith video about coilguns and I was blown away. Magnetism is something that really fascinates me and I really want to complete this project because magnet. Must I say more?
